# Hi there, I'm Youssif Salama 👋

### Full Stack MERN Developer

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with a focus on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by learning **Nest.js** and **Jest** to improve my backend and testing skills.

I have some experience with **hosting**, **VPS** setups, and **SSH**, which has been valuable in deploying and managing applications.
